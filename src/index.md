# Character Abilities

## Strength

This attribute represents a character's physical power and ability to exert force. It often
determines how much a character can carry, the damage they can inflict in physical combat, and their
prowess in feats of raw physical strength.

## Dexterity

Dexterity measures a character's agility, reflexes, and balance. This attribute is crucial for tasks
requiring fine motor skills, like lock picking, as well as in combat scenarios where quick movements
are essential, such as dodging attacks.

## Constitution

This attribute represents a character's health, stamina, and overall physical resilience. A high
constitution usually means more resistance, better endurance, and a greater ability to
withstand physical hardship or illness.

## Intellect

This attribute gauges a character's reasoning, memory, and learning ability. It impacts skills
related to knowledge, problem-solving, and often determines a character's ability to cast and resist
certain spells.

## Willpower

Willpower is a measure of a character's mental fortitude, determination, and discipline. It plays a
crucial role in resisting mental and magical influence, enduring psychological stress, and sometimes
in the casting or resisting of certain types of spells or abilities.

## Personality

This attribute represents a character's charisma, charm, and ability to interact effectively with
others. It often influences skills related to persuasion, deception, and leadership. In many games,
personality affects how NPCs perceive and react to the character.
